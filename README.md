# Phishing-Scam-Simulation
A simulation that allows you to learn more about how a phishing scam might work.

This simulation will have the user create fake credentials and go through a process that they might do everyday. This simulation contains replicas of everyday services, such as the Google and Email services. At the end of the simulation, the user will be told how to look out for phishing scams.

# PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS FOR EDUCATION PURPOSES ONLY AND NO HARM IS INTENTIALLY INFLICTED.

This was inspired by Google's very own Phishing Scam Quiz.
